# snappy.js[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kesla/snappy.js.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/kesla/snappy.js)

A implementation of the snappy-algorithm

## Installation

```
npm install snappy.js
```

## Stability

__unstable__: APIs may change, right now _only_ snappy.uncompress is implemented.

## Performance

There's a simple benchmark in test/benchmarks/bench.js that compares uncompressing in snappy.js and snappy. Here's the results running on my machine:

```
snappy: 12ms
snappy.js: 211ms
```

I hope to squize out some more performance out of snappy.js, but I doubt that it will every get as quick as snappy.

## Example

```javascript
var snappy = require('snappy.js')
  // compressed is a snappy-compressed buffer
  , raw = snappy.uncompress(compressed)

console.log('original data:' + raw.toString())
```

## API

*  __uncompress__(compressed) is a synchronous function, taking the input (a Buffer) and returns the output (as a buffer) decompressed.

* __uncompressedLength__(compressed) is a synchronous function, taking the input (a Buffer) and returns the size of the decompressed data.

* __isValidCompressed__(compressed) is a synchronous function, taking the input (a Buffer) and returns _true_ if it's valid compressed data and _false_ otherwise.
